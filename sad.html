    <h1> Open when... you're sad :(</h1>
    <h2>Dear Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling down or having a bad day :(. All I ever want is for 
        you to be happy, because you deserve the whole world. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        I hope you can treat yourself to a treat or some rest & relaxation to help yourself feel 
        better. Maybe some extra <a href="https://youtu.be/axiGV09C85A?t=48">Youtube</a> or 
        <a href="https://www.1001games.com/sport/table-tennis-ultra-mega-tournament">ping pong</a>. 
        And if not, please, feel free to call me. I'd love to cheer you up. Or you don't even 
        have to tell me what's wrong. I know the sound of your
        voice always makes me feel better. I hope I can do the same for you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you so much. Whatever it is, it will pass. Tomorrow is a new day. And as much of a 
        complainer and Debby Downer as I tend to be, I truly believe that things tend to work out. :)
        <br>
        <br>
        Again, I love you so much buggie, and I'm always thinking of you, and you're always in my heart. 
        Feel better! 
        
    </p>
