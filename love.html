    <h1> Open when... you wanna know why I love you &lt3</h1>
    <h2>My dearest, Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        So you wanna know why I love you. I could go on and on and on... lol. this reminds me of the 
        time you asked for a small compliment. I literally sent a novel; you sent back Tanks. The 
        iMessage game. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyway, Oh, where to start. Well, first of all, you're the cutest person in the whole world. 
        And the hottest. And the sexiest. And the most handsome. And I'm seriously not just saying that.
        You have the most perfect and beautiful eyes. I love your nose. And your lips are perfect. And
        I could kiss your cheeks forever! Not to mention your smokin' hot bod. I could worship your 
        legs. You know that. And your arms. and every inch of you. OwO. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Okok enough of your looks, cuz that's just scratching the surface. You're so insanely smart. 
        Not just smart, but intellectual and curious. You really, like, love to learn, and I love that 
        about you. It's a huge turn on. I could listen to you talk for hours and hours. Also, similarly,
        you're informed and knowledgeable about things. Like, stuff going on in the world and math and 
        so much more. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You're also funny. Even though your humor is often just teasing me, yes, you make me laugh. I 
        love to laugh with you. So much. And making you laugh is such a reward to me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You're laso just a really good person. You're sweet, caring, generous, kind. I love how you're 
        so forgiving, never hold a grudge, never really gossip or talk about other people poorly. You
        care about the environment. And so much more. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, maybe this is a self-centered answer to why I love you, but, like, we're the same person.
        You're so much like me. From volleyball, squash (!), thrifting, Adventure Time, The Night. You 
        just get me like no one else. You're really my best friend and twin flame. And I'm so lucky I 
        could call you mine &lt3.
        <br>
        <br>
        If I had to choose just one of my favorite things about you, it'd probably be your passion and
        intensity. Sure, I roll my eyes when you go crazy over connect four or demolish me in ping pong,
        but I truly admire how you give 110% in EVERYTHING you do. It's super admirable. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You inspire me to be my best self and try at everything I do, and learn all I can. And I couldn't 
        ask for more.
        <br>
        <br>
        I could go on. But I'm running out of space [or at least I was on paper]. So just know... 
        I LOVE YOU MOSTEREST!
    </p>
