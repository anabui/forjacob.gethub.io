    <h2>Dear Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        Happy first day of classes! I hope you enjoy all your classes this semester, and I know you'll
        excel in all of them. I also hope you enjoy your four day weekend... every week >:|
        <br>

        I know you're gonna kill it! You are the smartest and most hard-working person I know. I know you
        doubt that, but it's true. You're curious and smart, intellectual and so driven. Please go easy on 
        yourself. Don'e be so hard on yourself. Make sure you cut yourself some slack every now and then.
        <br>
        <br>
        Either way, I wish you the best luck, but more importantly, productivity, motivation, and good 
        professors. I'm always very down to flora! Also down for study breaks hehe. Whether that's a new
        show we can start or just TikToks... if you ever get ios 15.1 :8|

        Anywhosies, I love you, my smarticle particle!
    </p>
