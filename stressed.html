    <h2>Hello my dearest,</h2>
    <p> 
        I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling stressed or discouraged :( I know it sounds dumb, but 
        trust me when I say that it WILL pass and you WILL get through this. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Don't forget to take some time to rest and recharge. Don't be too hard on yourself either! 
        I'm proud of you no matter what. You're the most hardworking and dedicated person I know. 
        Really. And I know if anyone can get through this, it's you. Just take it one thing at a 
        time. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You got this!! >:) hehe. And feel free to hit me up if you need a flora or study break or 
        just wanna say hi :3. I love you so much and wish I could squeeze right now!
        <br>
        <br>
        You'll get through this. And it's all gonna be okay. Hey, if you want, just say the word 
        and I'll drop out and sign a lease on a place for our flower shop. a ha. jk.... unless. 
        <br>
