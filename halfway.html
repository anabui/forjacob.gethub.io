    <h2>Hi,</h2>
    <p> 
        If you're reading this, it means we're about halfway through the semester! How exciting! I 
        hope classes and everything have been going well. I hope long-distance hasn't been too hard for 
        us. And if it's been tough, I hope we've been adjusting well. I hope you know how much I love 
        you, and how I just never wanna lose you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You reading this also means spring break is coming up... Owo. I REALLY hope I can see you :}
        It's funny because literally today I got ~video evidence~ of my dad saying he'd let me fly 
        (rather than drive) somewhere. I hope he sticks to that. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I already really miss you. I can't imagine March Anita, lol. I'd really, really love to see you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Either way, only half more to go. And if not spring break, then hopefully I'll see you in May! 
        (But I'm manifesting spring break :D). 
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you so much and know we can get through this. We've gotten through a LOT together. 
        Just getting one more under the belt lol. 
        <br>
        I love you lots and hope you are well my dear. 
    </p>
