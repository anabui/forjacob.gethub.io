    <h2>Dear Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        If you're reading this, you unpacked/ are unpacking. How exciting! I know I've been super 
        sad about you leaving, but I hope you know I'm genuinely super excited for you! Studying 
        abroad is such an amazing opportunity, and I know you're gonna have an amazing time and make
        the most out of it. I'm jealous! But really, I'm super happy for you. I can't wait to hear
        all about it and see lots of pics that you will definitely be taking. hehe. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When you're done settling in, or even before, I'd love a facetime tour of your room and whole
        apartment! I'd love to see what my little interior designer has cooked up. And where certain 
        pictures/ posters have found a home (which, again, you really don't have to hand any of my 
        cringe simp art up O///O).
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyway, this is a super exciting time. It's gonna be tough, at least for me, being away from 
        my favorite person & Emotional Support Human, but I konw we'll make it work & get through it & 
        gain many exciting new experiences! Twice the experiences, to be exact.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you so much!
    </p>
