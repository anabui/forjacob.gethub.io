    <h1> Open when... it's Valentine's Day! </h1>
    <h2>My dearest Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        Happy Valentine's Day! Our first valentine's as a couple! The first of many, I hope. It just
        blows that we can't be together :( But either way, I'm so happy to celebrate US today! I hope
        we can do something nice today, like maybe a movie and facemask? No matter what, I'll be glad
        to spend it with you.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you so much. For so many reasons. If you haven't opened the "Why I love you" letter, I'll
        summarize. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides you're being literally the hottest person on earth (and cutest and most handsome), you're
        kind, crazy smart, funny, passionate, driven, thoughtful, fun, talented, and so much more. You're
        my best friend in the world, and I really don't know what I'd do without you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you have a great day and that we can celebrate! You're the best ever. Thank you for being
        your. 
        <br>
        <br>
        HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!! I LOVE YOU &lt333
