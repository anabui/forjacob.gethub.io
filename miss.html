    <h1> Open when... you miss me :,(</h1>
    <h2>Dearest Jacob,</h2>
    <p> 
        If you're reading this then you miss me :( I know that I miss you more though. Maybe I'm not 
        a fortune taller or psychic, but I believe the past predicts the future, and every time we've 
        been apart... yeah, I missed you. A lot. It incites, like, a physical reaction in me. The point
        is, I miss you too. So much. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Because now I'm in my feels. lol. Thinking about being apart from you.
        We've never neen apart for this long... I never wanna be apart from you for this long again :(
        <br>
        <br>
        Sorry, I know I'm needy. I just love you so much. I don't think you realize how happy you make 
        me. Like, I'm sure you know your ~influence~ over me, and how you have me wrapped around your 
        finger. But you genuinely make me so happy. Like everything's okay. I could me having the worst
        day. But you'll walk in and I'll instantly be happy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyway, it won't be long. We'll see each other soon :) Until then, call me! Let's have a little
        virstual date soon :3 We could watch a movie or show or play games. Any time spent with you is 
        perfect to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I really love you. I'm gonna squeeze you and never let go the next change I get.
    </p>
